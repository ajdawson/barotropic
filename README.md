# A spectral barotropic model in Python

This repository contains a package `barotropic` that conatains code for
solving the non-divergent barotropic vorticity equation using a spectral
method.


## Requirements

The `barotropic` package requires the following dependencies:

* numpy
* netCDF4
* pyspharm

The example notebook requires in addition:

* ipython-notebook (jupyter)
* iris
* geoviews


## Using the model

See the example notebook `simple_models.ipynb`.
